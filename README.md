# oshop
Ecommerce component developed for a bootstrap based theme (e.g. ecbootstrap) for Apache OFBiz™ and ORRTIZ™.

##Development
Just put the following in the svn:externals properties of the hot-deploy folder of your OFBiz implementation for a checkout:

oshop         https://github.com/ORRTIZ/oshop/trunk

After having updated the hot-deploy folder (to execute the checkout from the repository), you'll need to build OFBiz again (./ant build) and load the seed, seed-initial and  - optionally- demo datasets.

## Implementation
Instructions on how to implement can be found here: [https://github.com/ORRTIZ/oshop/wiki/How-to-implement](https://github.com/ORRTIZ/oshop/wiki/How-to-implement)
